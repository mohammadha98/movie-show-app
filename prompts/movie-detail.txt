Please help me create an Angular component using Tailwind CSS that displays detailed information for a movie, similar to Netflix's interface. I need:

1. A "MovieDetailComponent" that shows a single movie's information
2. Use reusable "BannerComponent" that displays the movie's hero image and primary details
3. A section below the banner showing additional movie information

Requirements:
- Use Angular 17+ and Tailwind CSS
- Focus only on the UI implementation (no services or data fetching logic)
- The design should be responsive and follow Netflix's aesthetic
- dark theme with appropriate contrast

The component should display:
- Movie title, release year, rating, duration
- Genre tags
- Brief synopsis/description
- Cast information
- Similar movie recommendations

Please provide the complete component code including:
- Component TypeScript file
- HTML template with Tailwind classes
- Any necessary SCSS (though prefer Tailwind utilities)
- Example of how to use the component in a parent component

Please explain any complex Tailwind utility combinations you use.
