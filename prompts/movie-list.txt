Create a responsive movie list component UI for a Netflix-like web application. The component should display a full list of movies in a specific genre using mock data. Below are the specific requirements:

1. Container Layout :
Use a container with horizontal padding (px-4 md:px-10 lg:px-20) and vertical spacing (mt-8 mb-12) to match the styling of your existing project.
Add a title section at the top of the component:
Title text: Use bold font (font-semibold), size text-2xl, and white color (text-white).
Example title: Action Movies.
2. Movie List Design :
Display the movies in a grid layout with responsive columns:
On small screens (mobile): 2 columns.
On medium screens (tablet): 3 columns.
On large screens (desktop): 4 columns.
Each movie card should include the following elements:
Poster Image :
Use a placeholder image URL for the poster (e.g., https://via.placeholder.com/200x300).
Ensure the image maintains its aspect ratio (aspect-ratio: 2/3) and fits within the card (object-fit: cover).
Title :
Display the movie title below the poster in bold (font-bold), small font size (text-sm), and white color (text-white).
Example title: Sample Movie Title.
Vote Average :
Display the vote average below the title in green (text-green-500) and small font size (text-xs).
Example vote average: Vote Average: 8.5.
3. Card Styling :
Each movie card should have rounded corners (rounded-lg) and a hover effect:
Add a subtle shadow or scale-up effect on hover (hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300).
Ensure the cards are spaced evenly with consistent gaps between them (gap-4).
4. Responsive Design :
Use Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure the layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Test the design on various devices to ensure no content overflows or becomes unreadable.
5. Mock Data :
Include hardcoded mock data for 10 sample movies directly in the HTML. Each movie should have:
A placeholder image URL.
A sample title.
A sample vote average.
6. Consistency with Existing Design :
Ensure the movie list component matches the visual style of your existing project:
Use the same dark theme (bg-gray-900) and typography.
Reuse hover effects, transitions, and spacing from your existing components.
7. Optional Enhancements :
Add a "View More" button at the bottom of the list to indicate that more movies can be loaded. Style it with a red background (bg-red-600), white text (text-white), and rounded corners (rounded-lg).
Example button text: View More.
Provide the complete HTML and CSS code for the movie list component using Tailwind CSS. Ensure the final design is clean, visually appealing, and fully responsive across all devices
