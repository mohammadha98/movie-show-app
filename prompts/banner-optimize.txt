Optimize the provided Netflix-style banner component to ensure it is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes. Below are the specific issues to address and the desired improvements:

1. Responsive Video Scaling :
Replace the fixed transform: scale(1.5) on the iframe with a dynamic solution that ensures the video scales proportionally without cropping or overflowing on smaller screens.
Ensure the video maintains its aspect ratio and fits within the container on all devices.
2. Text Responsiveness :
Adjust the h1 and p elements to dynamically resize based on screen width:
Use Tailwind's responsive utilities (e.g., text-4xl md:text-6xl) to scale the title (h1) and description (p) appropriately.
Ensure the p element does not overflow by wrapping text properly and adjusting its width dynamically (w-full on small screens).
Add line-clamp functionality to the p element to truncate long descriptions gracefully on smaller screens.
3. Button Layout Optimization :
Ensure the buttons (Play and More Info) remain horizontally aligned on larger screens but stack vertically on smaller screens without overlapping or looking cramped.
Use Tailwind's flex-col and gap-4 utilities to handle button stacking on small screens.
4. Gradient Overlay :
Modify the gradient overlay (bg-gradient-to-r from-black to-transparent) to adapt to smaller screens:
Consider using a vertical gradient (bg-gradient-to-b) on small screens to ensure better readability of the text.
5. Dynamic Height :
Replace the fixed height (h-[70vh]) with a dynamic solution that adjusts based on screen size:
Use min-h-[70vh] or h-auto to allow the banner to shrink on smaller screens while maintaining its proportions.
6. Pointer Events :
If the iframe is intentionally non-interactive (pointer-events: none), add a visual cue (e.g., a play icon or overlay) to indicate that the video is purely decorative.
Alternatively, make the video interactive by enabling pointer-events and ensuring proper controls are available.
7. General Responsive Design :
Ensure the entire banner layout adjusts gracefully on smaller screens:
Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:) to fine-tune the design for different screen sizes.
Test the layout on various devices to ensure no content overflows or becomes unreadable.
Provide the complete HTML and CSS code for the optimized banner using Tailwind CSS. Ensure the final design is clean, visually appealing, and fully responsive across all devices
